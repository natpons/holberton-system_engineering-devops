## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/mTOwCk7vlvpScjuBL0zyZA "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
-   You must be able to explain what each component is doing
-   You must be able to explain system redundancy
-   Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Requirements

### General

-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
-   This project will be manually reviewed:
-   As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
-   Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use  [imgur](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/QorG0rvw1PzqWBVrqWW6Sg "imgur")  but feel free to use anything you want).
-   For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
-   After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
-   You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
-   Focus on what you are being asked:
-   Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
-   Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
-   Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
-   In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
