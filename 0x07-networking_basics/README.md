## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/aVNeUbmv5XGxE2BXVPHOTg "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google**:

### OSI Model

-   What it is
-   How many layers it has
-   How it is organized

### What is a LAN

-   Typical usage
-   Typical geographical size

### What is a WAN

-   Typical usage
-   Typical geographical size

### What is the Internet

-   What is an IP address
-   What are the 2 types of IP address
-   What is  `localhost`
-   What is a subnet
-   Why IPv6 was created

### TCP/UDP

-   What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
	-   What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
	-   What is a port
	-   Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
	-   What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

## Requirements

### General

	-   Allowed editors:  `vi`,  `vim`,  `emacs`
	-   All your Bash script files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
	-   All your files should end with a new line
	-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
	-   All your Bash script files must be executable
	-   Your Bash script must pass  `shellcheck`  without any error
	-   The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly  `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
	-   The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

## More Info

	The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

	For multiple choice question type tasks, just type the number of the correct answer in your answer file, add a new line for every new answer, example:

	What is the most important position in a software company?

	1.  Project manager
	2.  Backend developer
	3.  System administrator

	```
	sylvain@ubuntu$ cat foo_answer_file
	3
	sylvain@ubuntu$

	```
